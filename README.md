# Book-A-Meal
Book-A-Meal is an application that allows customers to make food orders and helps the food vendor know what the customers want to eat.

# About
The project entails having a caterer as the site administrator and can add meals to the application as well as set menus for a particular day. The customers, after signing up first, are then allowed to book meals online.
